# MagAdventure
A short text-based adventure of complete meaninglessness. My christmas gift to @anastmag.

Text adventure system is adapted from "Adventure parser shell header file", By Martin Houston for CUG(UK), 25/5/86.

Some foul language and suggestive themes included.

## Download / Compile
* For Windows: download & run https://github.com/kostasvs/MagAdventure/blob/master/MagAdventure.exe
* For other systems (or if you like compiling stuff): Compile `main.c` and `adshell.h` (if you don't know how, google "compile c", quite easy)
